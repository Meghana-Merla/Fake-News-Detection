# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Prediction is a machine learning–based project that aims to identify whether a given news article is fake or real. The system uses natural language processing techniques such as text cleaning, stopword removal, and stemming, followed by TF-IDF vectorization. A classification model is trained on labeled news data to accurately predict the authenticity of news articles.
